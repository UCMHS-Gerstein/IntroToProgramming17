# SGO Pre-assessment
## Intro to Programming - Fall 2017

## Problem:
If we list all the natural numbers up to and including 15 that are multiples of 3 or 7, we get 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, and 15. The sum of these numbers is 66.

Find the sum of all of the multiples of 3 or 7 up to and including 3000.

## To be submitted:
* Written description of your algorithm to solve this problem (bullet points or numbered lists are preferred)
  * Typed document submitted through Google Classroom preferred; use space provided at the bottom of this document
  * If handwritten, you will be expected to write neatly. Engineering lettering is not required unless it’s necessary for me to easily read your handwriting.
* Flowchart depicting how you would solve the problem
  * PDF submitted through Google Classroom preferred; use filename “lastname pre-assessment flowchart”
  * If handwritten, you will be expected to write and draw neatly. Please use a ruler.

## Resources and recommendations
* www.draw.io is an easy tool for creating flowcharts and does not require an account
* When creating your flowchart, you may assume the computer understands basic math operations, can store lists of information, and can use variables. If you don’t understand yet what I mean by variables, don’t worry - it will be explained soon
* If this is very difficult for you, don’t stress. Do the best you can, but keep in mind this is only a pre-assessment.

## Sample algorithm from last class:
* Determine if a number is odd or even
* Choose an integer
* Divide the integer by 2
* If the remainder is 0, the number is even
  * Otherwise, the number is odd
