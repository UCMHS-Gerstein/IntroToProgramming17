# Version Control

Before we move on to more code, it's time to start using version control
+++
# What is it?

* Version control keeps track of your files and changes to them
* Enables you to have different versions without saving multiple copies
+++
# Why does it matter?

* Collaborating on documents is easier
* Very hard to lose work
* Can have different versions existing simultaneously
---
# Git

We'll be using git as our version control system. It's a great system, but it looks intimidating when you first see it. Instead of starting with the commands, we're going to start with [a bit of reading](IntroToProgramming17/Day17/git_story.md) and some discussion. When we're done, you'll [try this tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). Make sure you read the explanations - they're important!
