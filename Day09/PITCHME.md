Intro to Programming - Day 9

## Classwork

File: day09.py

Define three functions - ```find_circumference```, ```find_area```, and ```find_surface_area```. Each should take one argument called ```radius```. They should each return the appropriate number for the circumference/area/surface area of a circle or sphere with the specified radius.
+++
Use string formatting and the input function to call your functions in a way that will prompt the user for input and provide a nicely formatted printout of the answers, including descriptions.

To access pi, put ```from math import pi``` at the top of your program, and then you can refer to it as ```pi```
