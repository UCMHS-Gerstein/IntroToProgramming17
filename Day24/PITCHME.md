# Do Now:

Part 1
---
In a bash console, create a folder called intro-to-dicts. CD into that folder and use `git init` to turn it into a git repository

```shell
mkdir intro-to-dicts
cd intro-to-dicts
git init
```
Part 2
---
Choose a word. Use that word as a variable name. Create a dictionary with at least 5 items. The keys should be languages, and the value for each key should be the word's translation into the specified language. Assign the dictionary as the value for the variable you just created.

```python
kitten = {# The keys should be languages, and the value for each key should be the word you chose in the specified language'}
```
