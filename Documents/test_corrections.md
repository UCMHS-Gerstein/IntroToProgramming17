# Quiz Corrections

## General Policy

To prevent severe negative impacts from one or two bad days and to help students learn from their mistakes, I am permitting students to make corrections to their quizzes and submit those corrections to have their grade on the quiz adjusted to 85%.

## Submitting Test Corrections

* You will have one week from the assigned date.
* Submit your test corrections digitally.
* Google Drive will be fine. If you want something that will make it easier to show code, I can show you how to work with Markdown.

## Requirements

* Give me the correct answer for each question **and** an explanation of why this answer is correct.
* You must give me an explanation of all questions, not just the ones you got wrong.
* Good answers will likely be about 3-5 sentences.
