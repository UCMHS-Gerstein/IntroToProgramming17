# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2017

## Goal

Plan, code, document, and present a text-based game in Python.

## Criteria

Excellent work will include:

* Clean, well-written, effective code
* Version control in Git
* Clear documentation of how the code works
* A presentation of the game and of the process of creating it

## Expectations

### General

* This is an individual project. You may help each other, but you are responsible for your own work
* You may (and are encouraged to) use resources you find online, but may not outright copy somebody else's work
* Your work should challenge you, but be achievable

### Code

* Your code should make effective use of classes/objects. I have some examples to help you get started
* Your code should be thoroughly commented
* Your code should be managed through Git. I will not require branching, but as you reach good checkpoints, you should commit your changes.
* Your code should be as free of bugs as you can manage
