# Starting Python

Intro to Programming - Day 5
---
# Do Now

* Open up a terminal for Python 3
* Use the ```print()``` function to print 5 different things
* We'll have a quiz after everybody settles in
---
# Comments

```python
# This is a comment
# Comments let us include descriptions of what our code is doing
# We can also make other notes

# print "Hi, I'm a string" 10 times
for x in range(10):
    # Strings are a data type that stores text
    print("Hi, I'm a string")

print("Make a string by enclosing something in quotation marks")
# Single quotes work too
print('I am a string too!')
# Use whatever works best in a given situation
print("These double quotes don't mess with contractions.")
```

# Comments Are Important

* Make code easier to understand
* Communicate with others who need to use/edit your code
* Comment out line of code temporarily
* In class, you'll use them to show understanding of your own code
---
# Exercise

In a file called ```day05.py```, use the print function and place a comment describing it in the line above your print function
---
# Data Types

* Data has a variety of types
* For today: integer, float, string
---
# Math and Numbers

```python
# Addition
print(1 + 2)

# Subtraction
print(3 - 20)

# Multiplication
print(21 * 2)

# Division
print(100/3)
```
