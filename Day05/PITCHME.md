# Comments let us include descriptions of what our code is doing
# We can also make other notes

# print "Hi, I'm a string" 10 times
for x in range(10):
    # Strings are a data type that stores text
    print("Hi, I'm a string")

print("Make a string by enclosing something in quotation marks")
# Single quotes work too
print('I am a string too!')
# Use whatever works best in a given situation
print("These double quotes don't mess with contractions.")
